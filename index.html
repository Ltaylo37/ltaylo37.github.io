     <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <p>Her mother was a housewife until they got out to Washington, and then she worked for Boeing for a while. Her dad did a variety of different things. He started out as a salesman for a family company, the Fredrick Post Company, which was a company that sold drafting materials; he worked for them for a while. Then he sold furniture and school furniture in Illinois. In Hawaii he was a used car salesman,when they moved to the west coast, to Washington, he started learning how to build houses. He built his family a house, and then they moved in and he sold the last one, and then he built another one and they moved in. He was semi-retired, but doing things with investing.
		 In her mid-20s during her employment at an insurance company, she taught herself how to program computers.  Borg did not have any children, but she was married to Dr. Winfried Wicke, a Senior Manager at the IBM Research Division. </p>
      <p>Borg got married and gave up on her education because during this time women were taught to take care of their husbands. Borg said, "I quit school and was going to...work and put hubby through graduate school..." in an interview with Janet Abbate for IEEE History Center in 2001.Anita Borg studied at NYU and eventually went on to pursue a Ph.D..  She had a mentality to “...never have to depend on someone for support again…”  Borg’s thesis had theoretically dealt with operating systems and the synchronization of machines and how they worked.</p>
    <h2>Her Career</h2>
      <p>She was very adamant about changing the world through her advocacy for women because she noticed the lack of women in the world of technology.  She started Systers in 1987, and this allowed many women to connect and how they can utilize technology to bring awareness to women’s contributions to technology.  It initially started just to bring awareness to women in operating systems, but eventually grew into all disciplines of computer science.  Systers is one of the earlier representations of communicating online before online communities were created.  She met many of her associates through Systers, and Systers led to the development of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, an event hosted every year to celebrate women in the world of computers.  Anita Borg then created the Institute for Women In Technology.</p>
