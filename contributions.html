  <h2>Anita Borg and Women in the World of Computing</h2>
  <h3>Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing and the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology</h3>
    <p> Anita Borg is one of the major figure heads when it comes down to women in STEM, specially in computing and technology.  Borg was extremely dissatisfied with the lack of women in the computing, and she took many initiatives to increase women’s participation in the field, becoming an advocate for women in computing; she felt that the lack of women also made issues of equity arise in the world of computing, which is predominantly male field.  She started Systers in 1987, and this allowed many women to connect and how they can utilize technology to bring awareness to women’s contributions to technology.  It initially started just to bring awareness to women in operating systems, but eventually grew into all disciplines of computer science.  Systers is one of the earlier representations of communicating online before online communities were created.  She met many of her associates through Systers, and Systers led to the development of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.  Borg, then, co-founded the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in honor of Grace Hopper (a famous woman that helped pioneer early technology), and it is a conference where women in computing all over the world come and celebrate the contributions and highlights of women in computing.  She also created an institution for women in technology, later renamed after her in her honor.  One of her major contributions was when she led a research group because rather than focusing on how computers worked, she was interested in how they can be used to link people.</p>
