  <p>Anita Borg is one of the major figure heads when it comes down to women in STEM, especially in computing and technology.  Borg was extremely dissatisfied with the lack of women in the computing, and she took many initiatives to increase women's participation in the field, becoming an advocate for women in computing; she felt that the lack of women also made issues of equity arise in the world of computing, which is predominantly male field.  She started the Systers organization which sole purpose was to be an electronic community for women in computing, and eventually the organization grew exponentially in more than 50 countries.  Borg, then, co-founded the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in honor of Grace Hopper (a famous woman that helped pioneer early technology), and it is a conference where women in computing all over the world come and celebrate the contributions and highlights of women in computing.  She also created an institution for women in technology, later renamed after her in her honor.  One of her major contributions was when she led a research group because rather than focusing on how computers worked, she was interested in how they can be used to link people.  </p>

  <p>Anita Borg's legacy has inspired many women in the world of computing.  Borg is a former member of the staff at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center as she jump-started her career, and she created the Institute for Women and Technology to help increase recognition and impact that women have in the world of technology because women were not treated as equals in the world of technology.  She spent majority of her early career assisting  in the development of operational systems for Digital Equipment Corporation, Nixdorf Computer, and Auragen Systems Corporation, and even created Mecca, an email system for her Systers organization to help connect women in technology across the world in a virtual community.  She is an advocate for many issues of women in computing which include the Association for Computing Machinery, the Computing Research Association and the National Academy of Engineering, along with being one of the co-founders for the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.</p>

  <p>Anita Borg studied at NYU and eventually went on to pursue a Ph.D..  She had a mentality to "...never have to depend on someone for support again..." Borg's thesis had theoretically dealt with operating systems and the synchronization of machines and how they worked.  This lead to her being a member of her first computing occupation at Auragen Systems Corporation, and Borg named the developing operating system TARGON, which ended up being a product of Nixdorf in Germany.  Borg made her official debut at a conference directed by Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), this led to Borg becoming one of the most influential people of computing.  This milestone assisted her in obtaining a job with Digital Equipment Corporation, and she then relocated from Germany to California.  At this point, she began the development of Mecca, which initially allowed Borg and other women in computing communicate, being one of the original ways to electronically mail letters, etc, before the world wide web was created.</p>

  <p>Anita Borg's personal associates and friends remember her in this documentary.  She was very adamant about changing the world through her advocacy for women because she noticed the lack of women in the world of technology.  She started Systers in 1987, and this allowed many women to connect and how they can utilize technology to bring awareness to women's contributions to technology.  It initially started just to bring awareness to women in operating systems, but eventually grew into all disciplines of computer science.  Systers is one of the earlier representations of communicating online before online communities were created.  She met many of her associates through Systers, and Systers led to the development of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, an event hosted every year to celebrate women in the world of computers.  Anita Borg then created the Institute for Women In Technology.  </p>

  <p>Anita Borg received many awards for her advocacy for women in technology, throughout her career.  One of the awards is the Heinz Award. The Heinz Award is awarded to people that show excellent service in various fields, and Borg received the award for her hard-work and advocacy for women in the field of technology.  Borg had encouraged many women of all ages to embrace their love for computing and to be motivated to do what they were passionate about.  She received her Ph.D. of computer science at New York University  in 1981.  She saw that there was a significant lack of women in the computing world, so she created Systers as a way to e-mail and a sharing network that provides contact with many women across the world.

   <p> The Grace Hopper Celebration is the worlds largest gathering of women in technology. It allows women in technology from all over the world to come together to share ideas and help new technologists strive in our society today. They have guest speakers and many activates for women to learn new ideas in technology.</p>

   <p>The women of this celebration are striving for greatness. In this article they say, I am coming for you Elon. Elon Musk is one of the most successful technologists in this generation. These women are aiming to be better than the best. They are giving inspiration and hope to be better than the best there is right now.</p>

   <p>This specific annotation is from a woman who experienced her first Grace Hopper Celebration. She stated that she has been in the technology field for 25+ years and this was her first conference that was for women. She expresses the energy she feels from all the power of women at the event. She tells her story of the
  whole experience and how helpful the event is to women in technology.</p>

   <p>Another annotation I have explains everything in accordance to the Grace Hopper Celebration. It tells of how they became an organization. It states also that the atmosphere there is similar to the NFL Draft. Companies are also at the celebration looking for women who excel in the field that they could use to further their companies.</p>

   <p>The Grace Hopper Celebration helps women all over the world find work and gives them ideas of their own they could use to further their knowledge on technology. From everything I have read about the celebration it shows me that this is one of the best technology conventions for women that there is. It really helps women get their names out there to potentially get a job in technology.</p>
